# DataVaisualization

Introduction:

    This project is about using the JavaScript library D3 to read in data from a csv file and visualiz the data using the force-directed graph.
    
The two files:

-Index.html: This file contains the code the display the visualization.

-graph.csv: This file contains the data to be presented in the html file.

Setup:

First, in the command prompt or terminal, type this command       python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &

The command will start a local server. We need the server running.

Then, in the browser, type  http://localhost:8888/Desktop/folderthatcontainsthehtmlfile/thehtmlfile.html

There will be lagging in the website probably because there are too many nodes. Reducing the number of data in the graph.csv file can make the lagging disappear.
