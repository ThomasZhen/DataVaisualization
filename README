This file contains the intruction of how to use this application.

For MAC system, on the same directory where the app.js file is located, do the following:
npm install express.js
npm install socket.io

To run this application, on terminal, go the the directory where the app.js file is located, and then do:
node app.js

If you see listening on localhost:3000, that means the program runs fine. Go to the browser and type localhost:3000 and you will see the UI.

If you encouter the following error, try to do node app.js again, sometime you need to do it multiple times and the 
error will go away. 
This error doesn't always pop up, it pops up casually, so it is difficult to debug. When it doesn't pop up, the program runs just fine.
The error occurs because the max variable in the app.js file is 0, the only reason for it to be 0 is because it didn't get asisgn a value in the 
fs.readFile("blocks.json", function(err, data) function. However, the only reason it didn't get assign a value is because this function fails to read the file.
But this function never throw any errors, and this below error doesn't alwasy show up, so it is difficult to debug.
